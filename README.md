### Welcome to CCW4238: Operational Metrics API

In case you are not able to install python on your local machine to participate
in the Metric Push lab this Cloud9 template has been created for you to be able
to follow along and push metrics into your instance.

This project comes with the base scripts and all required python modules already
installed, so you do not have to worry about setting up your workspace or
installing python libraries. Simply follow along with the lab as if this were
your computer.
